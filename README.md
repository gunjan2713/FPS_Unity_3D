🔫 First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game
This project is a First-Person Shooter game created as part of a workshop tutorial and major assignment. It reflects weekly progress and includes core gameplay mechanics such as patrol-based enemies, interactive environments, a dual-weapon system, and a full HUD. The game combines both outdoor and indoor scenarios to deliver a complete FPS experience.

🎮 Features Implemented
✅ Hybrid Terrain: Outdoor to Indoor

The game begins in a mountainous outdoor setting with urban elements, transitioning into a secure indoor facility for close-combat encounters.

✅ Two Weapon Types

Players can switch between:

A precise, slow-firing pistol

A rapid-fire machine gun with longer range

✅ Health and Shield System

Players have both a life bar and a shield bar.

When taking damage, the shield absorbs most of it until it reaches zero.

After that, the life bar takes full damage.

✅ HUD Display

A clean and responsive HUD constantly shows:

Life bar

Shield bar

Current weapon

Ammo count

✅ Locked Doors and Key Mechanics

Certain doors are locked and require the player to find and collect specific keys to proceed.

✅ Enemy Patrol AI with Alert Logic

Enemies patrol the environment.

If they see the player, they engage and shoot.

If they hear footsteps nearby, they perform a 360-degree scan before resuming patrol.

✅ Complete Sound Integration

Sound effects are implemented for:

Walking/running

Shooting

Jumping

Taking damage

Picking up items

Opening doors

✅ Game Over & Restart Logic

A game over screen appears upon player death.

The player can restart the level from the beginning.

⭐ Optional Bonus Features Implemented
🟩 Pickups (Health, Shield, Ammo, Keys)

Scattered throughout the map and dropped by defeated enemies.

🟩 Checkpoint System

If the player dies after reaching a checkpoint, they respawn at the latest checkpoint instead of starting over.

🟩 Dead Zones

Hazardous areas like lava pits or cliff edges have been added to increase risk and encourage navigation skills.
